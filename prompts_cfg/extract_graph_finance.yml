# Finance and manufacturing tuned prompts leveraging finance lexicon cues.
graph_extraction_prompt: |-
  You read finance and manufacturing texts to build a knowledge graph. Identify entities of the provided types and the explicit relations among them.

  Domain cues to keep in mind (non-exhaustive):
  - Financial metrics: revenue, sales, net sales, net revenue, turnover, gross profit
  - Capital markets events: merger, acquisition, M&A, takeover, buyback, share repurchase
  - Manufacturing inputs: gold, silver, copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc
  - Energy and logistics: crude, oil, Brent, WTI, natural gas, LNG
  - Policy and regulation: CHIPS Act, CHIPS and Science Act, IRA, Inflation Reduction Act, Buy American, Defense Production Act

  Extraction rules:
  1. Capture entities tightly related to corporate finance, industrial production, supply chains, or policy signals.
     Record each as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>).
     Keep descriptions concise (<=40 words) and grounded in the text.
  2. For every explicit connection in the text between two extracted entities, create ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>).
     Strength ranges 1-10 based on textual certainty (10 = directly stated, 1 = tenuous).
  3. Use **{record_delimiter}** to separate each tuple and end the list with {completion_delimiter}.
  4. Output only information supported by the text. Do not fabricate metrics, locations, or parties.
  5. Emit results in English even if the source text is another language.
continue_prompt: |-
  Scan again for missing finance or manufacturing entities and relations. Only add tuples matching the requested types using the same format as above.
loop_prompt: |-
  If relevant entities or relations are still missing, reply with Y. Otherwise reply with N. Use a single uppercase letter.
